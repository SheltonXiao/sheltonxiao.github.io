<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Tongji University, specializing in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC). 

My research interest includes applying data-driven methods to building energy systems' operation and optimal control, as well as utilizing time series characterization and causal modeling to enhance the physical principles underlying these models in the context of building energy data. 

I have published several peer-reviewed papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UHHn4yEAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>350+</span></strong></a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UHHn4yEAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
